<b>Phase 2</b> : Connected the application to a Flask API allowing for a better interface for the users using the application.
Allowed the user to add items, reviews, and search for categories. With this, the user is also not allowed to review, 
post, and more.

<b>Phase 3</b> : Added lists for expensive items, users posting twice, filtering users based on their comments | date | etc. We 
also base item lists on most number of items within a date range. Posts never receiving comments or categories can also be filtered, etc. 
We can also display users whoe posted certain things.
