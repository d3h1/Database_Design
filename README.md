# Database_Design
Phase 1 : Created a GUI that allowed users to signup, signin, and initialize a database with hashing and other security features.

Phase 2 : Connected the application to a Flask API allowing for a better interface for the users using the application.
Allowed the user to add items, reviews, and search for categories. With this, the user is also not allowed to review, 
post, and more.
